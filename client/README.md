This project was made for Primetrade.ai
Used MERN stack for this as told
 

 Mainly three features were done

 1.User login
 2.Add agents
 3.upload file and distribute tasks

 so first a register page frontend was made
 later made a backend for it where it stores email and password (the mongodb Employee model was made)

 then the login page was made where it checks if the email exists then if yes redirects to the homepage

 in the homepage we can add agents (it takes the details of them) (the mongodb agent and item models were made)

 then a CSV file can be uploaded which is parsed 

 then below it distributes the tasks to each person

 finally the dashboard was made from where the sign in and register can be done

use node index.js to start the server
use npm run dev for starting the frontend
